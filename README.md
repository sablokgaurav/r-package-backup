# r_package_customization
r functions for the r package customization so that it will be easier and it returns a character array and also you can change to vector if you want and scalable. Why i wrote this code as i read this post on the R blogger and you can find the post here [RPost](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/07/quick-way-of-installing-all-your-old-r-libraries-on-a-new-device/) and you will find it longer way and you cant even find the vector and search the space for the install. I recently changed my system and so i coded a iterative way to get a vector and then use that for the installation.
